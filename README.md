## 📖 Who Am I? (The Short Version)

Hey! I'm just a 7th grader from a tiny village who asks WAY too many questions about literally everything. My teachers hate it, but I like to know the "why" before the "what" 😄

I love **three things**: Physics (especially time machines), Sports (Kabaddi supremacy!), and Gaming (Last Island of Survival is LIFE).

## 🧠 The 3 Things About Me

### 🔬 **Physics Geek**
I'm obsessed with time machines and the universe. Seriously. I could talk about BLACK HOLES and TIME TRAVEL for 5 hours straight (and I have 😅). My dream? Become a physicist and maybe invent a time machine. *Is that too much to ask? 🤪*

### ⚽ **Sports Champion**
Give me a sport and I'll try it:
- **Kabaddi** - My life during sports season
- **Kho Kho** - I'm quick, I'm speedy, watch me go! 💨
- **Cricket, Badminton** - Anything that gets my adrenaline pumping!

I hate losing. Like, REALLY hate it. So I practice a lot 🏆

### 🎮 **Gaming Maniac**
I'm ALWAYS gaming when I get the chance:
- Building shelters in *Last Island of Survival*
- Crushing it in *Ludo* (sometimes 😂)
- Finding new games every week like a treasure hunter

Gaming has taught me that losing 100 times before winning once is totally normal 🎯

## 🚀 My Dreams (Keep It Real)

**Right Now**: Do well in school, especially physics. Get better at gaming. Win sports tournaments. Maybe learn coding.

**Later On**: Become a physicist. Possibly build a time machine (LOL but also serious 👀). Explore space. Make cool discoveries. Inspire other kids to dream big too.

### ✨ Final Thoughts

I'm just a kid from a small village trying to do big things. I'm awkward sometimes, ask too many questions, and I get WAY too excited about physics. But that's me! 🤷‍♂️

If you're also from a small place with big dreams - you got this! 💪
